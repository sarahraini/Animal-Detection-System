# Animal-Detection-System
Road accidents involving animals are a growing concern in Sri Lanka, especially in rural and animal-prone areas. This study presents an animal detection system integrated with voice alerts. The system is adaptable for various types of land vehicles, offering a cost-effective and scalable solution to mitigate animal-vehicle collisions. The author aims to explore how effectual is the developed system in detecting animals on the road in real-time? The primary objective is to develop an effective sensor-based animal detection system for land vehicles to prevent animal vehicle-collisions, thereby enhancing road safety and animal protection.The prototype was developed using an ESP32-CAM module to capture real-time video, processed through the YOLOv3 algorithm using OpenCV and Python for object detection. An ultrasonic sensor measured proximity, and a microcontroller programmed via Arduino IDE controlled alerts and stopping mechanisms. The methodology involved real-time field testing in both daylight and low-light scenarios.The system demonstrated 80–85% accuracy under good lighting and successfully triggered alerts. However, accuracy reduced to 40–50% in low-light conditions. These findings validate the concept but highlight the need for improved night-time detection.This system offers a promising step toward intelligent vehicle safety in animal-prone areas. Future enhancements like high performance cameras may improve night detection. Expanding this solution for railway systems is also under consideration.
