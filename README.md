# Animal-Detection-System
The primary objective is to develop an effective sensor-based animal detection system for land vehicles to prevent animal vehicle-collisions, thereby enhancing road safety and animal protection.The prototype was developed using an ESP32-CAM module to capture real-time video, processed through the YOLOv3 algorithm.
